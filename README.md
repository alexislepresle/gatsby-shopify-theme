## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby Shop site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new shop-gatsby-shopify https://github.com/alexislepresle/gatsby-shopify-theme
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd shop-gatsby-shopify/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
